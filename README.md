This repository holds the information, structure and design in [https://priyanktrivedi.org](priyanktrivedi.org).

### Inspiration ###

This is a fork of a website - [https://www.adrianmoreno.info/](https://www.adrianmoreno.info/).

You can find the template open sourced independently from this site in https://github.com/zetxek/adritian-free-hugo-theme.

### Generation ###

The content is generated with [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/), a very fast, flexible and tuneable static content generator. It's made with golang. I built my first website using hugo and time and again come back to it. 

#### Running locally
1. [Installing Hugo](https://gohugo.io/getting-started/installing/) is a pre-requirement. 
2. Clone this repo.
3. Run `npm install` to install required packages for theme
4. Run `npm i -g postcss-cli` to use PostCSS with Hugo build
5. Using [Hugo CLI](https://gohugo.io/getting-started/usage/), run `hugo serve` build and check changes locally on http://localhost:1313/ 

### Deployment

The code in this repo is deployed using Netlify.

### More? ###

Do you want some more info about how or why I did some thing on the site? Drop me a line! (the form is connected to [formspree.io](https://formspree.io/) by the way, another great piece of software).
